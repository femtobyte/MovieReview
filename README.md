# Movie Review
Swift iOS Course project



2 issues that I am dealing with are:

- WKWebView won't load IMDb.  It will load other websites, although not all.  
- Some pics from photo album are turned sideways when saved.  I thought it might have to do with the position of the camera when photo was taken, but not sure.
